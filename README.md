# HRV-WA
HRV-WA algorithm, based on Frequency MÃ¶bius  Modulated (FMM) models, analyses 24-h HRV rhythms directly from RR data. HRV-WA not only predicts HRV, but also identifies and assigns Direct, and at times, Guided wave(s) involved in the analysis.

# How to use 
HRV-WA is achieved in R and is easy to use. 
The code provided in this GitHub replicated the four steps described in [citation].

Run the R script named runHRV-WA.R to ,conduct the methodology.
The file dataExample.RData is loaded on the R script and serves as example of 24-h RR data across 5-min time intervals.

INPUTS: 
  - Vector of RR data (data).

RUN:
````
load(file="dataExample.RData")
HRV_WA(data=dataExample)
````

OUTPUT:
  - Matrix with the FMM parameter estimations for Direct (and Guided) FMM wave(s) assigned.
